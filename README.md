# ChainVoter
(Solution for Codefundo++ 2019)


Hello world, in this project we are trying to make the electronic voting/polling process in the elections a smoother sail for everyone involved in it, by using Azure Blockchain to make things more secure, transparent, reliable and effective.

Our main aim is to make sure that every eligible reident of the country gets to vote with minimal effort on their part (other than the effort of deciding who to vote for) so that people can wield one of the most important rights they have in a democracy. We want to make sure that everyone gets to vote, gets to vote for whoever they want and gets the assurance that their vote is going to the right place. 

Other than this, our mission is to make this proccess as transparent as possible so that all issues can be traced back to and handled at the source. We want to eradicate any cases of people not being there on the voters list, or not being able to vote from a different constituency, or claiming that their vote did not go to who they voted for
