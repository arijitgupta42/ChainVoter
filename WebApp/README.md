Clone the git repository, go to the Login and Registration folder and on the command prompt type `npm install` to get all the related dependencies then do the same by going to the Face Login directory.

Go the Login and Registration folder and in the terminal type `npm start` and it will start on `localhost:3000`

Similarly, when you go to the Face Login folder, and type `npm start` it will start on `localhost:8181`

Now go to the Rest of the App folder and type `npm install` to download all dependencies, and then type `npm start` or `ng serve` and it will start on `localhost:4200`

Close all browser windows that may have automtically opened, start the browser yourself, and go to `localhost:8181` to begin the process.
