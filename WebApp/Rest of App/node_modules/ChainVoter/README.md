# ChainVoter
(Solution for Codefundo++ 2019)


Hello world, in this project we are trying to make the electronic voting/polling process in the elections a smoother sail for everyone involved in it, by using Azure Blockchain to make things more secure, transparent, reliable and effective.

Our main aim is to make sure that every eligible reident of the country gets to vote with minimal effort on their part (other than the effort of deciding who to vote for) so that people can wield one of the most important rights they have in a democracy. We want to make sure that everyone gets to vote, gets to vote for whoever they want and gets the assurance that their vote is going to the right place. 

Other than this, our mission is to make this proccess as transparent as possible so that all issues can be traced back to and handled at the source. We want to eradicate any cases of people not being there on the voters list, or not being able to vote from a different constituency, or claiming that their vote did not go to who they voted for.

With our solution people will not be required to stand in line at polling booths and will even be able to vote from outside their constituency as long as they have their aadhaar and voterid detials at hand. To get started with our application people will simply need to go to the website and register themselves there on the eve of election day. Then on election day they can simply login with their unique details and cast their vote comfortably. 

For people without/with limited internet connnectivity we hope to organize booths that can provide free internet for a limited peroid of time on providing suitable details (aadhaar, voterid). For those without devices capable of running our application, we plan to place multiple master devices in those booths themselves so that those people can come and vote in those devices. 

While our method still makes people with poor/no internet connectivity and people without laptops/smartphones stand in line, it still makes their voting process easier and transparent. Meanwhile for people with both internet and smart devices, it makes voting possible from the comfort of their home.
